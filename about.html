                    <p>My name is Geneva and I go to Michigan State University. I am majoring in Information Science with a focus area in Human Centered Technology. This blog is something I created using HTML for my MI 349 class assignment with Professor Siarto.</p>

                    <p>I have been playing The Sims for 10 years now. I started at age 10 with The Sims 3 base game on the shared family computer. I have since extended my collection to include multiple packs from The Sims 3 and 4. I like to keep up with Sims news on Twitter and YouTube and stay in the loop. My favorite aspect is build mode, and I dislike sim creation. I am excited to continue my journey with The Sims 5!</p>
                    <p>Here are a few of my favorite Sims 4 packs:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Get Famous</li>
                        <li>Snowy Escape</li>
                        <li>City Living</li>
                        <li>Interior Decorating</li>
                    </ul>
