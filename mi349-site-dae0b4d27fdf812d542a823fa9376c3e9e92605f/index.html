        <h2>Sims3 Expansions that are worth $100!!</h2>

         <p>The sims3 is an open world game filled with cars, taxis, classic character dynamics, and of course nostalgia. These intricate details are seen in the packs which can have players occupied for years. Lets start with Nightlife.
         Sims3 nightlife includes skyscrapers, a NYC based world with clubs, celebrities, and vampires all in one pack users can get from best buy for $20. If you wanted the the sims3 nightlife features in sims4[vamps, celebs] you would have to buy sims4 cityliving[$40], Vampires pack[$20] and get famous[$40]. That is 100$ vs $20. The create a sim in sims4 nightlife is awesome as well, with vampire accessories, celebrity dresses, and trendy nightclub outfits. Not to mention the build mode which I remember fondly in nightlife. You can really work on the apartments with the ability to use elevators, and the fruniture is a mix of gothic vampire, renassiance, and modern. Another pack that is worth 100$ is Island Paradise. In this game users can place their sims on houseboats[which are fully functional lots that they can drive], and my favorite part: the ability to build and design your own resort. The creative capabilities in this were endless and it reminded me of a tycoon game, such as Zoo Tycoon. You could fire and hire workers, check your financial information, and decide even the small things like what food your buffett would serve.  </p>

        <h2>Sims5 has been teased, and here is what needs to be added</h2>
         <p>-Geneva

        </p>
        <p> I'm really hoping the game designers have too much free time and stumble upon this blog I made for class. What we've seen of the sims5 buildmode is awesome [Can change dimensions and color wheel of all objects], and im really excited. Here are some random things I'd like to see again. 
        <div>
        <ol>
        <li>Get rid of neighborhoods.
            "Neightborhoods" are just a copout from continuing to make sims the open world game it deserves to be. When i say neighborhoods I mean that sims in sims4 can only free roam in their "neighborhood" of the map, and if they want to enter a new lot they're met with a loadscreen. </li>
         <li>Bring back transportation
            I miss the sims having to buy cars or get taxis and carpools and see them drive to work/ their event. It made the whole experience realistic and made me feel in control of my sims. The carpools with coworkers was so fun, and saving up for a car was honestly a big part of gameplay that they removed.  </li>
         <li>More lifetime rewards. I have no desire to fulfill my sims wishes because not many of the lifetime rewards are good or new. Maybe some new careers could spice this up </li>
         <li>Career traits/involvment. 
            Careers without traits/rewards feel like they're all the same when sims magically teleport away for 7 hours... The salary person career in Sims4 Snowy Escape gives new traits and abilities. I love this and have every sim do that career. 
         </li>
