        <h2>Sims3 Expansions that are worth $100!!</h2>

            <p>The Sims 3 is an expansive game that digs deeper than the sims 4. Sims are more complex with more trait options, favorite foods amd colors, astriological signs, and autonomy. In the Sims 3, you get to watch your sim go to workplace via taxi, carpool, or buying a car. Everything about it felt more real than the loading screens we see in the Sims 4.
                The expansion packs in The Sims 3 were deeper as well, packing enough content to mirror multiple Sims 4 packs combined. I was thinking of some examples.
                The Sims 3 nightlife includes skyscrapers, celebrities, and vampires all in one
                pack people can get for around $20. If you wanted The Sims 3 nightlife features in sims4 [vampires,
                celebrities] you would have to buy sims4 cityliving[$40], Vampires pack[$20] and get famous[$40]. That is
                My favorite pack is Island Paradise. In
                this DLC users can place their sims on houseboats, which are fully functional lots that they can drive.
                My favorite feature is the ability for users to design and manage their own resort. The creative capabilities in this
                were endless as it combined in-depth management and design like that of a tycoon game with the ability to play as the sims and make it feel real. Users could fire and hire workers,
                check their financial information, and decide even the small things like what food their buffetts would
                serve. </p>

            <h2>Things I'd like to see in The Sims</h2>
            <p>-Geneva
                10/26/23
            </p>
            <p> As EA continues to release expansion packs, it's looking unlikely that we will see a Sims 5 anytime soon. Here are some things I'd like to see in The Sims.
            <div>
                <ol>
                    <li>Bring back transportation.
                        I miss the sims having to buy cars or get taxis and carpools and see them drive to work and
                        events. It gave users extra factors to think about, like should they live close to work? or move to a city where they can walk more?
                       Saving up for a car was a big part of gameplay in The Sims 3 because without one, taxis cost money.
                     </li>
                    <li>More interesting lifetime aspirations. I would love to have aspirations be challenging, and require time and effort. Many of the aspirations that come with expansion packs feel like tutorials, and feel like a tutorial task rather than a gameplay element. </li>
                    <li>Career traits/involvment.
                        Careers feel like they're all the same when sims magically teleport away
                        for 7 hours... The salary person career in Sims4 Snowy Escape gives new traits to sims as they progress in their career. I
                        love this and think it could be cool if it was added to more careers.
                    </li>
                    <ol>
