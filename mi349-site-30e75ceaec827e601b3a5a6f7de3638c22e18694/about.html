    <h1>About Me</h1>
    <p>My name is Geneva and I go to Michigan State University. I am majoring in Information Science with a focus area in Human Centered Technology. This blog is something i created using HTML for my MI 349 class assignment with Professor Siarto. </p>
    <p>I have been playing the sims for 10 years now, I started at age 10 with the sims3 basegame on the shared family computer. I have since extended my collection to include multiple packs from sims3 and 4. I like to keep up with sims news on twitter and youtube and stay in the loop. My favorite aspect is buildmode, and I hate sim creating. Yay for the gallery.</p>
    <p>Here are a few of my favorite sims4 packs:</p>
    <p>
    <ol>
        <li> Get famous</li>
        <li>Snowy Escape</li>
        <li>City Living</li>
        <li>Interior Decorating</li>
    </ol>
