    <h2>Sims3 Expansions that have so much gameplay</h2>

    <p>The sims3 is an open world game filled with cars, taxis, classic character dynamics, and of course nostalgia for og simmers. 
        Sims3 nightlife includes skyscrapers, a NYC based world with clubs, celebrities, and vampires all in one pack users can get from best buy for $20.lets compare this to the sims4 version: The sims4 Cityliving gives users a city map, that is not even condensed btw, and that is all. If you wanted the the sims3 nightlife features in sims4[vamps, celebs] you would have to buy sims4 cityliving[$40], Vampires pack[$20] and get famous[$40]. That is 100$ vs $20. The create a sim in sims4 nightlife is awesome as well, not to mention the build mode which I remember fondly in nightlife. Another pack that is worth 100$ is Island paradise. In this game users get houseboats, resorts, and my favorite part: the ability to build and design your own resort. The creative capabilities in this were endless and it reminded me of a tycoon game, such as zoo tycoon. You could fire and hire workers, check your financial information, and decide even the small things like what food your buffett would serve. Sims4 took all of this out and remade it with just the map in the exxpansion Island Living. Pretty dissapointing, but this won't stop me form going back and enjoying island paradise. </p>

    <h2>Sims5 has been teased, and here is what needs to be added</h2>

    <p> I'm really hoping the game designers have too much free time and stumble upon this blog I made for class. What we've seen of the sims5 buildmode is awesome, and im really excited. Here are some random things I'd like to see again. 
    <ol>
    <li>Get rid of neighborhoods.
            "Neightborhoods" are just a copout from continuing to make sims the open world game it deserves to be. When i say neighborhoods I mean that sims in sims4 can only free roam in their "neighborhood" of the map, and if they want to enter a new lot they're met with a loadscreen. loading every location was  brutal on the 6 year old family desktop i started playing on.  </li>
    <li>Bring back transportation
            I miss the sims having to buy cars or get taxis and carpools and see them drive to work/ their event. It made the whole experience realistic and made me feel in control of my sims. The carpools with coworkers was so fun, and saving up for a car was honestly a big part of gameplay that they removed. RIP flexing on townies in my cool cars.   </li>
    <li>More lifetime rewards. I have no desire to fulfill my sims wishes because not many of the lifetime rewards are good.  </li>
     <li>Career traits/involvment. 
            Careers without traits/rewards feel like theyre all the same when sims magically teleport away for 7 hours... The salary person career in Sims4 snowyescape gives new traits and abilities. I love this and have everyone do that career. 
    </li>
    <ol>
